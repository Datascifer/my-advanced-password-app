# 🛡️ Advanced Password Maker 🛠️

Hi there! I created the **Advanced Password Maker** to help you generate secure passwords and store them safely. 🚀 It’s built using Flask and PostgreSQL and is perfect for anyone who wants a simple and user-friendly password management tool.

## 🎯 Features

- 🔐 **Secure Password Generation**: Create strong passwords with customizable options like uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.
- 💾 **Password Storage**: Save your generated passwords in a PostgreSQL database for easy access later.
- 📋 **Saved Password Viewer**: View all your stored passwords in a clean and organized table.
